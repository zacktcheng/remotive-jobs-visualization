# Remotive Job Visualization

### Intro
This is the final project for the Spring 2024 CSPB 4122 Information Visualization course at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Remotive Job Visualization is a data visualization project to visualize the query results from the search engine https://remotive.com/. Remotive.comâ€™s Remote Job API provides software development remote work opportunities around the globe. Though it can fetch an immense amount of job posts containing a great amount of information on each job description, it's not easy for a job seeker to have a quick overview of some key information across many job posts he or she potentially will apply. In another scenario, the user may not actively search for jobs but just want to discover some job market trends that could help to prepare for the right skills in the future. A set of visualization tools will be good solutions for both scenarios.
